# Maven
### Below is an example of a Dockerfile for building a Maven image, along with the corresponding commands to build and run the Docker image:

**Dockerfile:**

```Dockerfile
### Use an official Maven runtime as a parent image
FROM maven:3.8.4-openjdk-17-slim

### Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

### Copy the pom.xml file into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY ./pom.xml .

### Copy the source code into the container at /usr/src/app
COPY ./src ./src

### Build the application
RUN mvn clean install

### Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

### Define the command to run the application when the container starts
CMD ["java", "-jar", "target/your-artifact-id.jar"]
```

Make sure to replace `"your-artifact-id.jar"` with the actual JAR file generated by your Maven build.

**Building and Running:**

1. Save the Dockerfile in a directory, let's say `maven-docker`.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile.

3. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-maven-app .
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image with the tag `my-maven-app`.

4. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 my-maven-app
   ```

   This command runs the Docker container and maps port 8080 from the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

Now, your Maven application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. Adjust the port mapping according to your application's requirements.

Note: Ensure that you have a valid `pom.xml` file and the necessary source code in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
