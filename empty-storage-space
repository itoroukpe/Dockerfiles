The error message "No space left on device" indicates that your system's storage is full, preventing Docker from writing necessary files. Here are some steps to free up space:

### Step 1: Check Available Disk Space

First, check your disk usage to see if Docker or other directories are using a lot of space:

```bash
df -h
```

### Step 2: Clean Up Docker Resources

Docker containers, images, and volumes can take up significant space. Clean up unused resources using the following commands:

1. **Remove Unused Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker container prune -f
   ```

2. **Remove Unused Images**:
   ```bash
   docker image prune -f
   ```

3. **Remove Unused Volumes**:
   ```bash
   docker volume prune -f
   ```

4. **Remove Unused Networks**:
   ```bash
   docker network prune -f
   ```

To perform all of the above cleanup tasks in one command:

```bash
docker system prune -a -f --volumes
```

> **Note**: The `-a` flag removes all unused images, not just dangling ones, so use it carefully.

### Step 3: Free Up System Disk Space

If space is still low after cleaning Docker resources, try removing unnecessary files or applications on your host system. You can check which directories are taking up the most space:

```bash
du -h --max-depth=1 /
```

### Step 4: Restart Docker and Try Again

Once you have freed up space, restart Docker and attempt to bring up the containers:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker-compose up -d
```

These steps should help resolve the issue and allow Docker to function normally.
