# E-Commerce - Ebay
Docker Compose file for an e-commerce Java-based web application for eBay with the specified services:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  login:
    image: ebay-login-service:latest
    container_name: ebay-login
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    networks:
      - ebay-network

  registration:
    image: ebay-registration-service:latest
    container_name: ebay-registration
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
    networks:
      - ebay-network

  checkout:
    image: ebay-checkout-service:latest
    container_name: ebay-checkout
    ports:
      - "8083:8083"
    networks:
      - ebay-network

  payment:
    image: ebay-payment-service:latest
    container_name: ebay-payment
    ports:
      - "8084:8084"
    networks:
      - ebay-network

  order:
    image: ebay-order-service:latest
    container_name: ebay-order
    ports:
      - "8085:8085"
    networks:
      - ebay-network

networks:
  ebay-network:
    driver: bridge
```

In this Docker Compose file:

- Each service (Login, Registration, Checkout, Payment, Order) is defined as a separate service block.
- For each service:
  - An image is specified. Replace `ebay-login-service:latest`, `ebay-registration-service:latest`, etc. with the actual image names for each service.
  - A container name is specified for easy identification.
  - Ports are exposed to allow access to the services. Adjust the port mappings as needed.
  - Each service is connected to the custom network named `ebay-network`.

- A custom network named `ebay-network` is defined with the bridge driver.

Make sure to replace `ebay-login-service:latest`, `ebay-registration-service:latest`, etc. with the actual image names of your Java-based web application services. Additionally, adjust port mappings and other configurations as needed based on your application requirements.

You'll need to build the Docker images for your Java-based web application services separately and push them to a Docker registry before using them in the Docker Compose file.
